# Dice Game 2

## Description:
This game is a remake of my Dice Game with improvements listed in the [improvements](https://github.com/Merlot44/DiceGame2/tree/master#improvements) section.

## Improvements:
Added a second dice for more complexity.  
Added a background and changed the layout for a more user-friendly interface.  
Added sound effects and background music as well as a button to control them.

## Statistics of the game:
Due to adding a second dice, the odds of winning are no longer 1/6 or 16.66%. Now, the odds have changed to the following:  

Chosen number: (number of possibilities that equals the chosen number / number of total possibilities) * 100  
```
2: (1 / 36 ) * 100 = 2.77%
3: (2 / 36) * 100 = 5.55%
4: (3 / 36) * 100 = 8.33%
5: (4 / 36) * 100 = 11.11%
6: (5 / 36) * 100 = 13.88%
7: (6 / 36) * 100 = 16.66%
8: (5 / 36) * 100 = 13.88%
9: (4 / 36) * 100 = 11.11%
10: (3 / 36) * 100 = 8.33%
11: (2 / 36) * 100 = 5.55%
12: (1 / 36) * 100 = 2.77%
```
Therefore, players now have a higher sucess rate with the number 7 than with other numbers.
